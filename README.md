# Lane and Object Detection

This project makes use of Hough Transform, Color Thresholding and Axis of Symmetry to detect Lane markings, other vehicles and traffic signs from a video stream from a car dashboard camera.

The video demonstration for the project can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmGhNxHbacvhgSK5oNMXz8nXFDlz9EzN/view?usp=sharing

## Key Features
- Uses Hough Transform to detect Lane markings
- Calculates offset from the center of the lane
- Uses Axis of Symmetry to detect other vehicles
- Uses Color Thresholding to detect Highway Signs
- Code is optimized to run on a video stream in real time
